Introduction
=======================================

This tutorial is about how to make a technical presentations with
cool animations. When I first asked around, people recommended
either (1) using OpenOffice or (2) buying a Mac. This page gives a walkthrough of
the another method using LaTeX, Python, and TiKZ. Here's an example of
a talk developed in this way.

   </center>         

And here's an example of the presentation we'll build in this tutorial.

   </center>         

The code for the tutorial can also be downloaded from its `github repository <https://github.com/srush/beamer-animation/>`_.

Problem Description: K-Means
========================================

So assume that we have to give a talk for class on the 
`K-Means algorithm
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering>`_. We'll want to include technical slides describing its mathematical definition, so using LaTeX makes sense. However it is also helpful to see the algorithm on an example, so we want to include an animation. 

First let's assume we have a simple implementation of k-means.
 


.. code-block:: python
         
   def hello():
      """This function"""
      print "hello"
